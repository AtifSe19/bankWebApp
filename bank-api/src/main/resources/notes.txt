hasRole vs hasAuthority

if you use hasRole, then you have to mention the role as ROLE_USER (prefixing the role with ROLE) in the db, you can also mention the role as
ROLE_USER in the bracket of the hasRole, but writing ROLE_USER for the hasRole in the db is mandatory.

if you use hasAuthority, then it is not mandatory to have the role as ROLE_USER, you can simply define it as USER, but
the name and format of the role in the hasAuthority bracket and the db should match.
